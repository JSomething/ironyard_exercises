# Ironyard Exercises

Homework for Jed's lecture on [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org)

## How To

- solve the problem in Ruby (you need MiniTest installed `gem install
  minitest`)
  - in an imperative/procedural fashion
  - in a functional fashion (hint: use the `Eunumerable` module)
  - in an object oriented fashion

- solve the problem in JavaScript 
  - to the best of your ability without dependencies
  - with [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org) as a utility library

## Questions

- What solution in Ruby do you like best? Why?
- Are there patterns from your Ruby solutions that lend themselves to JavaScript solutions?
- Are there conveniences in Ruby you wish you had in JavaScript? Why?
