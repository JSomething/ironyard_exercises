Homework for Jed's lecture on [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org)

In order to understand how CoffeeScript fits into the web development
space, its important to understand what need it solves. We'll do that by
comparing solutions to a relatively simple programming problem in two
languages you already know (I think).

## How To

- solve the problem in Ruby (you need MiniTest installed `gem install
  minitest`)
  - in an imperative/procedural fashion
  - in a functional fashion (hint: use the `Eunumerable` module)
  - in an object oriented fashion

- solve the problem in JavaScript 
  - to the best of your ability without dependencies
  - with [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org) as a utility library

Yes, you may work in groups. No the homework is not graded, but you
won't get much out of the lecture if you have not done this prep and
that would be a waste of time for me and you. If you work with others,
be sure you understand the language decisions made.

## Discussion

Come to the lecture 9/19 ready to discuss the following questions.

- What solution in Ruby do you like best? Why?
- Are there patterns from your Ruby solutions that lend themselves to JavaScript solutions?
- Are there conveniences in Ruby you wish you had in JavaScript? Why?

## Feedback/Questions

Open a github issue. I'll gladly answer any questions.

## Credits

Both problems take from [exercism.io](http://exercism.io) but problems
in that application are served rather than picked so this just uses a
problem that is solved in roughly equal terms in several languages.
